# Module 1 Final Project

## Final Project Summary

You've made it all the way through the first module of this course - take a minute to celebrate your awesomeness!

![awesome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1/master/awesome.gif)

All that remains in Module 1 is to put our newfound data science skills to use with a final project! You should expect this project to take between 16 and 20 hours of solid, focused effort. If you're done way quicker, go back and dig in deeper or try some of the optional "level up" suggestions. If you're worried that you're going to get to 20 hrs and still not even have the data imported for analysis, reach out to an instructor in Slack ASAP to get some help!

## The Project

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

# The Dataset

On the same MySQL instance from last week, in the schema `movies`, is some movie-related data from:
* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

## Connection
As a reminder, the connection parameters:
* host: `hbs-ds-060120.c1doesqrid0e.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
* username: `hbs-student`
* password: <same as before>
* database: `movies`

# The Deliverables

There are three required deliverables for this project:

1. A well documented **Jupyter Notebook** containing any code you've written for this project and comments explaining it.
1. An organized **README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository.
1. A Github repository containing all of the above files and any additional files worth includding
1. [OPTIONAL] A short **slide deck** (delivered as a PDF export) giving a high-level overview of your methodology and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. If you do this, make sure to also add and commit this pdf of your non-technical presentation to your repository with a file name of presentation.pdf.

### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves

For this project, your Jupyter Notebook should meet the following specifications:

#### Organization/Code Cleanliness

* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow,  and code should be commented where appropriate.  
    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code.  All functions have [docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) that act as professional-quality documentation
* The notebook is written for technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.

#### Visualizations & EDA

* Your project contains at least 4 meaningful data visualizations, with corresponding interpretations. All visualizations are well labeled with axes labels, a title, and a legend (when appropriate)  
* You pose at least 3 meaningful questions and answer them through EDA.  These questions should be well labeled and easy to identify inside the notebook.
    * **Level Up**: Each question is clearly answered with a visualization that makes the answer easy to understand.   
* Your notebook should contain 1 - 2 paragraphs briefly explaining your approach to this project.

## Grading Rubric

This rubric is garbage, but if you'd like something to reference, use the top half of  [this](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1/blob/master/module1_project_rubric.pdf).  Reminder: this is not actually being graded.

## Summary

The end of module projects are a critical part of the program. They give you a chance to both bring together all the skills you've learned into realistic projects.

The projects are serious and important. They are not graded, but feedback will be given. Take the project seriously, put the time in, ask for help from your peers or instructors early and often if you need it, and treat the review as a job interview and you'll do great. We're rooting for you to succeed and we're only going to ask you to take a review again if we believe that you need to. We'll also provide open and honest feedback so you can improve as quickly and efficiently as possible.
